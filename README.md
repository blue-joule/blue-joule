- Hi, I’m @blue-joule, Mechanical engineering graduate from the University of Leeds.
- I’m interested in creating larger projects, both to learn new aspects of computer science
and to understand management of software development using GIT. 
- I’m currently reivsing my knowledge of python syntax, and building on the machine learning
taught during my degree.
- Currently I’m not looking to collaborate on any projects.
- Currently I don't want to be reached, using GITHUB more privately until I am more competent.
